# Waste-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

This project addresses the business problem of efficiently classifying waste into distinct categories to support automated waste sorting systems, a critical need in waste management for improving recycling efforts and reducing environmental impact. The classification of waste materials can significantly enhance the operational efficiency of recycling facilities, leading to better resource management and sustainability.

## Business Problem:

With the growing emphasis on sustainable practices, recycling and waste management are essential processes for minimizing environmental damage. Manual sorting of waste is time-consuming and prone to errors, creating a demand for automated systems that can classify waste materials accurately. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically classifying six types of waste (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and vegetation) based on image data. Improving the accuracy of waste classification would lead to increased recycling rates and reduced contamination in waste streams.

## Dataset:

The dataset comprises 2,864 labeled images across six categories of waste:

Cardboard: 461 images
Glass: 420 images
Metal: 547 images
Paper: 500 images
Plastic: 500 images
Vegetation: 444 images
The images were preprocessed, and a variety of deep learning models were applied to classify the waste types accurately.

## Methods:

We explored three deep learning architectures to classify the waste images:

Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A simple model with one hidden layer.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Two CNN architectures were developed, including the best-performing model, which consisted of multiple convolution layers, max pooling layers, and dense layers, with dropout to prevent overfitting.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Test Accuracy: Measures the model's ability to correctly classify unseen data.

Kappa: A metric that corrects for chance agreement, providing a more accurate measure of performance.

Precision: Measures the proportion of positive predictions that are actually positive.

Recall: Measures the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly predicted as positive.

F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.

## Experiments:

Twelve models were experimented with:

Model 3 and Model 11 consistently demonstrate strong performance across all KPIs, indicating their superiority in terms of overall classification accuracy and balanced performance.

Models 5 and 1 exhibit poor performance, likely due to overfitting or underfitting issues.

Models 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 show varying degrees of performance, with some models excelling in specific metrics while others struggle in others.

## Results:

Based on the visual representation, here are some specific interpretations:

Class-Specific Performance:

- Cardboard: The model correctly classifies most Cardboard instances (99), with some misclassifications as Glass (7) and Metal (2).

- Glass: The model also performs well for Glass, with 102 correctly classified instances. However, there are some misclassifications as Cardboard (13) and Metal (4).

- Metal: The majority of Metal instances are correctly classified (89), but there are notable misclassifications as Cardboard (9), Glass (6), and Paper (12).

- Paper: Paper instances are classified reasonably well, with 89 correct predictions. However, there are some misclassifications as Cardboard (22) and Metal (3).

- Plastic: The model struggles to classify Plastic instances accurately, with only 105 correctly classified out of 137.

- Vegetation: The model excels at classifying Vegetation, with 125 out of 127 instances correctly predicted.

Overall Performance:

While the model demonstrates good performance for certain classes (e.g., Vegetation), it struggles with others, particularly Plastic. This suggests that the model might benefit from further training or adjustments to address the classification challenges for these specific classes.

The worst-performing class in Model 3 is plastic, with the following metrics:

Precision: 0.51

Recall: 0.73

F1-Score: 0.60

This indicates that while the model is reasonably good at predicting plastic when it does so (precision), it often fails to detect plastic items (recall). The low F1-score reflects a balance between these two metrics, suggesting that plastic is harder for the model to correctly classify than other waste types.

Reasons for Poor Performance on Plastic:

Several factors may explain the poor performance for plastic:

Visual Similarities with Other Classes: Plastic may share visual characteristics with materials like glass or metal (e.g., transparency, reflective surfaces), causing confusion in the classification.
Inconsistent Representations: Plastic items come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, leading to greater variability in the data compared to more consistent materials like vegetation or cardboard.
Feature Complexity: The model may not have captured complex visual features unique to plastic due to limitations in architecture or training data.

## Approaches to Improve Performance:

Data Augmentation and Collection:

- Increase Plastic Data: Gather more samples of plastic waste to ensure the model is well-exposed to its variability.

- Data Augmentation: Apply augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping specifically to plastic images to improve model generalization.
Advanced Preprocessing:

- Class-Specific Augmentation: Introduce targeted augmentation techniques for plastic (e.g., adding noise, changing brightness) to make the model more robust to variability.

- Class Balancing: If plastic is underrepresented, use oversampling or synthetic data generation (SMOTE) to balance the dataset.
Modeling Techniques:

- Deeper Architecture: Incorporate more convolutional layers to capture complex patterns, especially for ambiguous classes like plastic.

- Attention Mechanisms: Add attention layers to help the model focus on key areas of the image that differentiate plastic from other materials.

Ensemble Methods:

- Model Ensembles: Combine predictions from multiple models, which may improve robustness for classes like plastic by averaging out errors from individual models.
Business Application and Real-World Deployment Considerations:

- Automated Waste Sorting: A highly accurate waste classification model can be deployed in waste management systems to automatically sort waste into categories. This would improve recycling efficiency and reduce human errors.

## Impact: 

More accurate sorting leads to better recycling rates, reduced contamination, and cost savings in waste processing. In real-world applications, the solution needs to handle larger and more diverse datasets, accounting for different lighting conditions, image qualities, and backgrounds.

## Deployment Concerns:

Hardware Requirements: The model must be lightweight enough to run in real-time on edge devices, such as cameras installed at recycling plants.

Maintenance: Regular retraining is needed as waste materials evolve (e.g., new types of plastic). Continuous data collection and model updates ensure the system stays relevant.

Accuracy vs. Cost Trade-Off: Achieving near-perfect accuracy may require high-end hardware and advanced models, which could drive up costs. Balancing performance and feasibility is key.

By addressing these challenges, waste classification can lead to more efficient and sustainable waste management practices.
